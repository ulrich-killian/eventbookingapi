                                        Event Booking API

A high-concurrency backend for event planning and seat reservations, built with a focus on data integrity and concurrency control.

                                     Architecture & Design

Service Layer Pattern — Business logic is decoupled from routes into dedicated services, keeping complex rules (especially around seat management) isolated and testable.

Concurrency Control — PostgreSQL Row-Level Locking (FOR UPDATE) is applied during booking and update flows to prevent race conditions and overbooking.

Atomic Operations — Seat allocations and cancellations are wrapped in SQL transactions. If any step fails, the system rolls back to maintain a consistent state.

Rate Limiting — API endpoints are protected against brute-force and DoS attacks.
Input Validation — Strict enforcement of future-event dating, email format, password strength, and positive seat counts.
